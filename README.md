# Playing with Gitflow. 

Push, merge, rebase, pull request - resolving conflicts, force push.

Git Bash commands, IntelliJ usage, and Sourcetree handling.

## To keep it interesting and technical, here are a few jokes :)
```
I tried to commit to a relationship,
but my wife insisted on creating a branch for every disagreement â€“ talk about version control issues!
```
```
My computer and I have a love-hate relationship;
it keeps pushing updates, and I keep pulling my hair out trying to figure out what changed.
```
```
The developer's New Year's resolution: commit to the gym and push for those code gains,
while branching out into the world of healthier snacks.
```
```
When the programmer got a cat,
they named it "Git" because it constantly pulls at their attention
and commits mischief whenever they leave the keyboard unattended.
